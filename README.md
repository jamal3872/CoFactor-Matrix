# COFACTOR

COFACTOR is a C++ program that computes the cofactor of a matrix, a fundamental operation in linear algebra. The cofactor of an element in a matrix is calculated by taking the determinant of the matrix formed by removing the row and column of that element, then applying a sign based on its position. This program allows users to input a square matrix of any size, such as 2x2 or 3x3, and automatically calculates and displays the cofactor for each element. It also handles error conditions, such as non-square matrices or invalid inputs. Whether you are a student learning about matrices or a developer needing matrix operations, this program serves as a helpful tool for understanding and applying matrix concepts. Key concepts include cofactor, matrix, and determinant.

## Features

Calculates the cofactor of a given matrix. Handles matrices of various sizes (2x2, 3x3, etc.). Includes error handling for invalid input.
